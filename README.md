# Boxing Project (Importance of KO%)

This project aims to show how KO% is linked with a boxer's sucess.

## Dataset 
The data I use project is taken from this person's project https://github.com/kaustav1987/EDA-Boxing-Dataset.git. The link was git cloned and the file was able to be saved to my laptop as .csv.

## Classification Algorithm
I use XGboost to predict the victor and the method of victory.
